PORTRAIT
A portrait photograph is a way of capturing a person’s appearance, personality and mood in a single image. It can be a valuable memory of a loved one, a creative expression of oneself, or a professional representation of one’s identity. A portrait photograph can also convey a message, a story, or an emotion to the viewer. Having a portrait photograph can help you preserve your history, celebrate your achievements, or share your vision with others.
